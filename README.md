## App Description

<ul> <li>The app offers standard expense tracking features, including a total budget and expense counter, along with a transaction history.</li> <li>Users can reset both their budget and expenses, as well as delete transactions. When a transaction is deleted, its impact on the budget and expenses is also removed.</li> <li>Clicking on a transaction displays additional details and provides the option to delete it.</li> <li>The app allows users to categorize their expenses. They can choose from three predefined categories or create custom ones.</li> <li>Users can view their budget and expenses in a pie chart for a clear visual representation of their financial situation.</li> <li>The app supports both dark and light themes, allowing users to select their preferred appearance.</li> <li>All user data is saved in the browserâ€™s local storage.</li> </ul>

## What I Learned

<ul> <li>Advanced knowledge of TypeScript types and type safety, becoming more familiar with the language.</li> <li>Gained deeper insights into React hooks, particularly the useContext hook, and its utility in managing state across multiple components.</li> <li>Acquired experience with the Mantine UI library, utilizing its components and hooks.</li> <li>Explored the HTML Canvas API to create a basic pie chart.</li> <li>Utilized external React libraries, including react-router and react-icons.</li> <li>Learned to use ViteJS for setting up a TypeScript-based React project, offering an alternative to create-react-app and manual TypeScript integration.</li> <li>Improved skills in inline CSS styling within React components.</li> <li>Enhanced understanding of JavaScript, focusing on array methods such as forEach, map, filter, and reduce.</li> </ul>

## Potential Future Upgrades

<ul> <li>Upgrade the app by implementing Redux for more robust state management.</li> <li>Explore additional UI libraries, such as Material UI and Chakra UI, to enhance the user interface.</li> <li>Improve mobile responsiveness by integrating CSS media queries or adopting TailwindCSS.</li> <li>Add backend functionality to the expense tracker, incorporating a database (likely MongoDB) for data storage instead of relying on local storage.</li> </ul>
